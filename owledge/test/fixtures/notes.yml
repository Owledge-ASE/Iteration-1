    In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list within a certain order.
    The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important
    for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to
    be within sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable
    output.
