  I want to see available notes

Background: notes have been added to the database

  Given the following notes exist:
  | notebook_id             | title               |  description
  | sorting_algorithms      | Sorting Algorithms  |  In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.
  | graph_theory            | Graph Theory        |  In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
