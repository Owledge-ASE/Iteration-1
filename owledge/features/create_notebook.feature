  | 3                       | Analysis of Algorithms  |  In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms | |
  | 4                       | Distributed Computing   |  A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system | |

  | 7                       | Bubble Sort            |  Compares adjacent elements and moves them | 1 |
  | 8                       | Merge Sort  |  Merges sorted arrays | 1 |
  | 9                       | Recursive merge  |  Runs recursively | 8 |
